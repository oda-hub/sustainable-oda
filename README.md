# Sustainable ODA

## Computing costs

Costs of Computing are large and growing

*Reusable (Scientific) Workflows and Data*, not unlike reusable bags, are reducing costs

Reuse relies on interoperability and communication - developing languages.

It's not a coincidennce that "Reusability" is both "R" in FAIR and one of the key directions of sustainable development.

*ODA makes finding and re-using previously computed data and workflows the first principle*

This poses and advantage comparing to precompute-all approaches which potentially produce not substantially untilized results.
